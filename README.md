# prophet-challenge
My coding project utilizes the Pandas library in Python within a Jupyter Notebook to access and analyze Mercado Libre sales data from a CSV file. The goal is to examine search trends, stock prices, and forecast future search trends based on the available data.

### Process:
1. **Setup:** Open the `forecasting_net_prophet_final.ipynb` file in a source code editor that supports Jupyter Notebooks and has Prophet installed. If Prophet is not installed in your current editor, I recommend using Google Colab.
2. **Running Cells:** Each cell contains code that, when executed, displays output below it. You can run a cell by clicking the play button at the top left corner of the cell or by clicking inside the cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`. This will also move you to the next cell.
3. **Output:** The output of each cell will display the results as specified in the comments, utilizing the Pandas library in Python to perform the necessary data analysis and forecasting.
